// Skill builder eval scenarios.
//
// Two fixed, approved analyses chosen to exercise the SkillBuilder's richer plan
// shape end to end:
//
//   • price-tracker — a recurring read-from-one-page-then-record task. It should
//     yield a **fixed** input (the canonical page URL), calculation steps (read the
//     figure, compute the change) and an action step (append the row), reaching for
//     web_fetch + the .xlsx file rather than driving the browser + a spreadsheet UI.
//   • github-issue-triage — the gh-vs-browser case, as a skill. It should generalize
//     to the `gh` CLI (never the browser), split "decide which issues qualify"
//     (calculation) from "comment + label" (action), and gate the mutating action
//     with a confirmation pause because it posts on the user's behalf.
//
// Together they assert the whole new contract: input `source` vocabulary, typed
// calculation/action steps, native-tool choice, and confirmation on the risky step.
//
// Both target this app's own library (`app`), whose agent has a shell, files, and web.
//
// A third group targets the **copilot-studio** catalogue — a hosted agent with NO
// shell, NO filesystem, and NO browser, only connector actions. These three cover the
// surfaces a maker actually wires up (Teams, Outlook mail, Calendar) and each asserts
// the right `Connector.Action` is reached for, while the browser (playwright/click and
// the *.office.com / teams.microsoft.com hosts) AND any device-shell command are
// forbidden — a Copilot Studio agent cannot run `gh`, `bash`, or read `~/…`.
