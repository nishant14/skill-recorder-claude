          This tool records your screen and activity so it can turn what you did into a reusable
          skill. Here is exactly what it captures and what leaves your computer.
        </p>

        <section className="sheet-block">
          <h3>While you're recording</h3>
          <p className="sheet-note">Only between Start and Stop.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Which apps you switch to, and their window and document titles.</li>
            <li>Web addresses of the pages you open.</li>
            <li>A short preview of text you copy, up to 120 characters.</li>
            <li>A silent video of your screen at a low frame rate.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="sheet-caution">
            Do not type, paste, display, copy, or narrate passwords, access tokens, API keys,
            credentials, secrets, or other sensitive or confidential information. Anything visible
            on screen can appear in the recording, and copied text previews and narration are
            captured too.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="sheet-block">
          <h3>Voice narration (only if you turn it on)</h3>
          <p className="sheet-note">
            Off by default. Choose the initial state and microphone with Narrate, then use the
            floating recording bar.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Enabling Narrate briefly opens and releases the microphone so the app can request
              permission and show the available inputs. No audio is saved during this check.
            </li>
            <li>Your microphone audio is saved only while it is on and a recording is running.</li>
            <li>
              Turning the microphone off ends that voice segment and releases the device. Turning it
              on again, or switching inputs, starts a new segment linked to the same recording
              timeline.
            </li>
            <li>
              To turn your voice into text, the saved audio is sent to your Azure AI Foundry
              deployment and transcribed there. The voice recording itself leaves this computer,
              not just the text, and it happens right after you stop, or when you analyze the
              recording, whichever comes first.
            </li>
            <li>
              The transcript stays in the language you select from the 99 supported choices; it
              is never translated. Without an Azure AI Foundry connection, the audio stays on
              this computer and is simply not transcribed.
            </li>
            <li>Leave Narrate and the recording-bar microphone off and no microphone is opened.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="sheet-block">
          <h3>Where it's stored</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Everything is saved on this computer, in the app's own session folder.</li>
            <li>Recordings stay until you delete them. You can delete any recording from Sessions.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="sheet-block">
          <h3>What's sent off this computer</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Nothing leaves your computer while you record.</li>
            <li>
              If you turned on Narrate, your recorded voice audio is sent to your Azure AI
              Foundry deployment to be transcribed.
            </li>
            <li>
              When you choose Analyze, the event timeline—including window and document titles,
              URLs, and clipboard previews—plus extracted screen images and narration text (if
              recorded) are sent to GitHub&apos;s cloud service and processed by GitHub Copilot.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="sheet-block">
          <h3>What it never does</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>It does not log your keystrokes.</li>
            <li>It only captures while a recording is running. Nothing runs in the background.</li>
