// Builder eval scenarios covering the full describer task set.
//
// The two GitHub scenarios (scenarios.ts) guard the specific gh-vs-browser bug.
// These eight mirror the describer evals (evals/scenarios/*) so the builder's
// GENERALIZATION stage is guarded across every task type we test — each ships a
// FIXED approved analysis (as the describer would emit it) and a rubric asserting
// the RIGHT native capability for that task.
//
// Two flavours:
//   • "prefer a real native tool" cases — a public page → web_fetch, a spreadsheet
//     → the .xlsx file itself, a cloud deploy → the az CLI, merged PRs → gh. The CLI
//     cases (gh, az) forbid the browser outright, because a headless native tool is
//     unambiguously correct. The web-read cases assert web_fetch is the tool reached
//     for, but do NOT forbid the browser: preferring web_fetch and documenting a
//     browser fallback for a page that may need a login is exactly the behaviour we
//     want, and a pure-browser regression is still caught (web_fetch would be absent).
//   • genuinely browser-legit cases (expense-report, lead-to-crm) — an app with no
//     API and no CLI (Amex/Expensify, Salesforce/LinkedIn) that must be driven
//     through its UI. Here we do NOT forbid the browser; instead we assert the ONE
//     sub-step that IS native (reading local PDF receipts; naming the mailbox as the
//     lead source), so the rubric stays honest. The app target has NO Microsoft 365
//     tools, so the directory and mailbox cases forbid an invented `workiq_*` name.
