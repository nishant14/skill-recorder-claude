# Skill Recorder

**Record yourself doing a task once, then turn it into a skill your AI agent can repeat.**

Skill Recorder captures a real work session on your screen: the clicks, the app and
window switches, the pages you visit, and (if you want) your spoken narration. It then uses
**your own Azure AI Foundry deployment** to reconstruct *what you actually did* as a clear
**intent plus an ordered list of steps**. From there, one step turns that single run into
something an agent can reuse:

- a **Skill**: a `SKILL.md` procedure an agent runs on demand, or
- an **Automation**: the same procedure on a schedule or trigger.

Either can be installed into **Skill Recorder's own library** or exported as a bundle for
a **Copilot Studio agent**.

Both prefer the agent's **native tools** (like the `gh` CLI or `web_fetch`) over replaying
UI clicks, and generalize from your one example, so recording yourself submitting *one*
form can teach the agent to submit *all* of them. Attach the target application's **API
reference** (an OpenAPI JSON spec, or just its written docs) to a recording and the steps
are grounded in real API operations instead of UI clicks.

## How it works

1. 🔴 **Record.** Hit record (or `⌘⇧R` / `Ctrl+Shift+R` from anywhere) and just do your
   task. Skill Recorder captures your screen and activity locally, in the background.
2. 🎛️ **Control.** While recording, a small always-on-top bar shows capture and
   microphone state. Mute, unmute, or switch mics on the fly, then finish, or discard
   (with a confirmation) if the take didn't go to plan.
3. 🧠 **Analyze.** Click Analyze and your Azure AI Foundry deployment reconstructs one
   overall intent and an ordered list of steps. Review and edit until it reads right.
4. ✨ **Create.** From an approved analysis, generate a reusable **Skill** and/or a
   scheduled **Automation**.

## Get started

Skill Recorder is published as a **source release**: one command downloads a pinned Node.js
runtime, builds the exact release commit on your machine, and adds a **Skill Recorder (Source)**
app you can relaunch anytime. Nothing is installed globally.

Analysis and skill-building run on **your own Azure AI Foundry resource**, so you'll need
its endpoint and an API key, plus three deployments on it: `gpt-5.3-codex` (builds skills
and automations), `gpt-5.2` (analyzes recordings), and `gpt-4o-transcribe` (narration).
Enter them in the app the first time you Analyze, or put them in
`~/.skill-recorder/foundry.json`.

macOS is the primary target. Windows 11 (x64 and ARM64) is supported too (see
[`WINDOWS-VALIDATION.md`](WINDOWS-VALIDATION.md)), as is Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 x64 on an
X11 session (see [`LINUX-VALIDATION.md`](LINUX-VALIDATION.md)).

### Install it

Open the **[latest release](https://github.com/microsoft/skill-recorder/releases/latest)** and
copy the command for your platform. Each release pins an exact commit, so the real command looks
like the patterns below with `<40-character-release-commit>` filled in.

**macOS / Ubuntu**

```bash
commit="<40-character-release-commit>"; curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/skill-recorder/$commit/install.sh" | SKILL_RECORDER_COMMIT="$commit" bash
```

The commit pins both the downloaded script and the source it builds. To keep the app running
after the terminal closes, add `SKILL_RECORDER_DETACHED=1` after the pipe:

```bash
commit="<40-character-release-commit>"; curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/skill-recorder/$commit/install.sh" | SKILL_RECORDER_COMMIT="$commit" SKILL_RECORDER_DETACHED=1 bash
```

On macOS this adds a **Skill Recorder (Source)** app to `~/Applications` (relaunch from Spotlight,
Launchpad, or the Dock). On Ubuntu it adds a matching application entry.

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
$commit="<40-character-release-commit>"; $env:SKILL_RECORDER_COMMIT=$commit; irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/skill-recorder/$commit/install.ps1" | iex
```

This adds **Skill Recorder (Source)** shortcuts to your desktop and Start Menu.

### Then record

1. **Grant Screen Recording.** On first launch, macOS asks for Screen Recording permission;
   grant it and you're ready to record.
2. **Record, Analyze, Create.** Do your task, then Analyze. The first time you Analyze,
   Skill Recorder shows a connection form for your Azure AI Foundry endpoint, API key,
   and deployment if you haven't set one up yet.

To inspect the script before running it, set install options, update, or uninstall, see
[`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md).

## What gets captured

Recording, storage, and frame extraction all happen **on your computer**; nothing leaves
while you record. Only when you choose **Analyze** does Skill Recorder send the event
timeline (window/document titles, URLs, and clipboard previews), extracted screen images,
and narration text to **your Azure AI Foundry deployment** for the model to process.
Narration audio is sent to that same resource to be transcribed.

The in-app "Records your screen and activity" panel spells out exactly what's collected:

- **Window tracking:** active-app / window switches.
- **Browser URLs:** the page you're on (macOS).
- **Screen video:** recorded by Chromium; low-rate snapshots are kept only when the
  screen changes or a heartbeat is due.
- **Clipboard:** short previews of copied text that tie steps together.
- **Narration** *(optional)*: spoken commentary, sent to your Azure AI Foundry
  transcription deployment and transcribed in any of its 99 supported languages.

> ⚠️ **Please don't capture secrets.** Passwords, access tokens, API keys, credentials, and
> other confidential information should never be recorded, typed, pasted, shown, copied,
> or narrated during a session.

## Develop from source

Requires **Node.js 24**. After checking out a release revision:

```bash
npm ci
npm run compliance:licenses
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts Vite and launches the Electron app with hot-reload; `⌘⇧R` (macOS) /
`Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) toggles recording from anywhere. Full manual setup, the build and
`dist` scripts, and the licensing boundary between local source builds and redistributable
packages are in [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md). Maintainers changing versions, dependencies,
assets, or releases must follow [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md).

## Evals

The **describer** and **builders** have a fixture-based eval suite; see
[`evals/README.md`](evals/README.md).

```bash
npm run eval            # score the describer against synthetic recordings
npm run eval:builder    # score the skill/automation generalization
```

  uninstalling, and manual developer setup.
